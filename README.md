# Degreed.DadJokes

For this solution to run as intended, the Degreed.DadJokes.Web solution calls the Degreed.DadJokes.Api solution.

Please set the following 2 projects to 'start up' when running the solution -
1. Degreed.DadJokes.Api
2. Degreed.DadJokes.Web

In Visual Studio, this is done by right clicking the Solution then selecting 'Set Startup Projects...'
